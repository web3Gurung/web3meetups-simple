      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Check the event titles and descriptions — hackathons usually include keywords like 'Hackathon,' 'Buidl,' 'Build-A-Thon,' or 'Ideathon' and span multiple days. Meetups are typically single-day events with titles like 'Community Meetup,' 'Networking Event,' or 'Info Session.' Workshops focus on learning specific skills and often mention technologies like Solidity, smart contracts, or specific blockchains. Conference events usually have 'Conference,' 'Summit,' or 'Conclave' in the title."
